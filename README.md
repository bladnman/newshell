# newshell

Very simple repo to hold files for a new shell. Initially, this is
only intended to hold a `.bashrc` file. Nothing private.

## Usage

To download and save this use the following command.
Remember to back up any `.bashrc` file you already have.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bladnman/newshell/main/.bashrc -o ~/.bashrc
```
